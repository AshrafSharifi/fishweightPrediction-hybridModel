HybridFishWeight

Enhancing deep learning models with mechanistic approaches for Rainbow Trout weight prediction

Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the weight of rainbow trout using a hybrid deep learning model that combines LSTM and CNN architectures. The approach leverages both temporal dependencies and internal bioenergetic patterns in the data collected from a rainbow trout farm in Preore, Northern Italy.

Our hybrid model integrates data-driven learning with domain knowledge about fish growth, making it more robust for predicting weight progression over time under varying environmental and feeding conditions.

Features

Predict rainbow trout weight based on environmental, feeding, and biometric data.

Hybrid deep learning model combining:

LSTM layers for capturing long-term temporal dependencies.

CNN layers for extracting local patterns from sequences.

Trained and validated on multi-year monitoring data from a real fish farm.

Includes preprocessing scripts for handling multi-parametric probe data and infrared biomass measurements.
